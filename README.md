# CppGraphicsThing

If you are reading this for some reason, welcome to my repo for learning about OpenGL!
CppGraphicsThing(Name Pending) will start as a place for me to work through ~~[the Learn OpenGL Website](https://learnopengl.com)~~ [ScratchAPixel](https://www.scratchapixel.com/). As I approach the end of the tutorial, I hope to use this repo as a source to create my own 3D rendering engine. I don't have a specific project in mine that would use it and this is purely for learning/fun, but I hope some fun project ideas will grow out of this ðŸ˜Š
