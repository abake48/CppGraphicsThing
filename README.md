# CppOpenGLThing

If you are reading this for some reason, welcome to my repo for learning about OpenGL!
CppOpenGLThing(Name Pending) will start as a place for me to work through [the Learn OpenGL Website](https://learnopengl.com). As I approach the end of the tutorial, I hope to use this repo as a source to create my own 3D rendering engine. I don't have a specific project in mine that would use it, but I have some small learning project ideas that I hope will grow out of this ðŸ˜Š
